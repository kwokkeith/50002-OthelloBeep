# 50002-OthelloBeep
Contains a custom designed CPU (named "NOT BETA CPU") assembled in lucid on an Alchitry FPGA. A modified Othello game that makes use of the custom instruction sets for this CPU and a written assembly script to execute. This project includes timing based logic, Othello/Reversi game logic, bit-banging of led matrix and buzzers, and an emulator created in python to emulate the custom CPU's assembly script.
